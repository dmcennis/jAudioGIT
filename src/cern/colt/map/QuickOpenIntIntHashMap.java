package cern.colt.map;

/**
Status: Experimental; Do not use for production yet. Hash map holding (key,value) associations of type <tt>(int-->int)</tt>; Automatically grows and shrinks as needed; Implemented using open addressing with double hashing.
First see the <a href="package-summary.html">package summary</a> and javadoc <a href="package-tree.html">tree view</a> to get the broad picture.

Implements open addressing with double hashing, using "Brent's variation".
Brent's variation slows insertions a bit down (not much) but reduces probes (collisions) for successful searches, in particular for large load factors.
(It does not improve unsuccessful searches.)

	Brent's variation does a local reorganization to reduce probes. It essentially means:
	We test whether it is possible to move the association we probed first (table[p0]) out of the way.
	If this is possible, it will reduce probes for the key to be inserted, since it takes its place; it gets hit earlier.
	However, future probes for the key that we move out of the way will increase.
	Thus we only move it out of the way, if we have a net gain, that is, if we save more probes than we loose.
	For the first probe we safe more than we loose if the number of probes we needed was >=2 (t>=2).
	If the first probe cannot be moved out of the way, we try the next probe (p1).
	Now we safe more than we loose if t>=3.
	We repeat this until we find that we cannot gain or that we can indeed move p(x) out of the way.

	Note: Under the great majority of insertions t<=1, so the loop is entered very infrequently.
